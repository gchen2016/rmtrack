RMTRACK -- Robust Multi-robot Trajectory Tracking under Delaying Disturbances  
=============================================================================

This repository contains an implementation of RMTRACK algorithm and the dataset used for experimental comparision as described in the paper:

Michal Cap and Jean Gregoire and Emilio Frazzoli: "Provably Safe and Deadlock-Free Execution of Multi-Robot Plans under Delaying Disturbances", IROS 2016 (in review), 2016.
